					Will inevitably die in the ironic proximity of some pigeons.
					<br><br>
					Long long ago, in the far away past of 2017, JR had a very important Decision to make. What would they do while waiting for Hiveswap to come out, which was DEFINITELY going to come out in January and you would be a fool for suggesting otherwise. They decided to try their hand at making a "roguelike" SBURBSim game that played itself and was different every time. The rest is history. Miraculously, the Sim didn't end when Hiveswap came out like eleven fucking months later.
					<br><br>
					JR enjoys coding, coding some more, doing stupid shit (usually involving code) and packing literally everything as full of secrets, easter eggs, and lucky charms as they can get.
					<br><br>
					JR is a sadistic puzzle master and definitely not bad at secrets.  Their Denizen is Janus, and it became retroactively a refrance to the Sim being founded in January.
					<br><br>
					All JR headcanons are true. Write your own, or let AB decide!<br><br>
