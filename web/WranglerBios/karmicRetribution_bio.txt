					So have you ever gotten interested in a friend's project, and then thought "Oh look, there's a small thing I can help them with! It should only take a few minutes, even!" And a few weeks later you found yourself using all of your spare time to work on the project?
					Yeah.
<br><br>
					Anyway, I'm karmicRetribution, Smith of Dream (because canon is for plebs), and I did most of the foundational graphics work on the sim. I try to stop JR from hate-macking on good taste so that we can all enjoy looking at the site instead of clawing our eyes out.
<br><br>


					Also, I accidentally enabled the Shogun's ascension. Whoops, my bad.
