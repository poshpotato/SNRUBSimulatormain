Void Sessions:
    -redo planets so theyâ€™re all dead
    -remove reckoning, replace with horrorterror eating timer (longer?)
    -remove all scenes with rings, kings, battlefield
    -add life/void ring shenanigans?
    -remove prototypings, make enemies skeletal
    -remove consorts, add consort ruins, maybe quest of revival?
    -add possible voidship ending?
    -no need for space time players
    -change planet quests to voidier
    -Additional ending to voidsim could be a revival of the session somehow, bullshit in a really hard way to win and i mean dead session hard

Add Frogs
    -Blue frog: "spiritual meaning of ascension, enlightenment, or rebirth" triggers if all of the players died and were revived (maybe twice). Flavor: its a sentient universe. On its way it goes.

Valhalla
    -We make ghosts fight it out and get stronger and stronger (maybe rewards?)
    -X matches sort of thing, slider like AB


Misc
    -Make AB report broken forge
