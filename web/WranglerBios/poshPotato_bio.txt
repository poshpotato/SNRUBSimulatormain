<p>Hi! I'm posh. poshPotato. I took a look at the sim and went "hmm. How can I fuck this up?"</p>
<br>
<p>Well, it was more like "Hmm. what the fuck is this i dont understand any of it" and then I went and read a book about programming and cried. but hey! Now I look at it and think "Hmm. what if I did this.." and break something.<p>
<br>
<h1>Progress!</h1>
<h3>Test</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you want to contact me i'm poshestpotato#3651 on discord, and a list of my changes to the sim <i>should</i> be in newsposts below. If I didn't break it again.</p>
