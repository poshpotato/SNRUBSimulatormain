					RecursiveSlacker, Seer of Void here.  I’m the guy hidden in the void, the first IdeasWrangler, designer of rap engines (holy shit I’m not sure how I pulled it off), spreadsheet-filling god, etc.  I know my GlitchFAQ, and I sorta know enough about code to suggest ideas that are relatively straightforward to code.
					<br><br>I was here pre-refactoring, pre-Discord even!  It was early april 2017 when I first sent a fucking deluge of ideas for JR to consider over Reddit after she posted an update for the sim there.  There are still so many that aren’t yet in, and the ideas pile keeps getting taller-- among my inspirational achievements are the aforementioned shitty rap generator, classpect and strife refactoring, alchemy, some small mechanics, some data entry, bug squishing (back when bugs were more common and more hilarious), and generally being a fun guy.  <span class = 'void'>  Something something Reishi Xanith. </span>  The sim has come a long way since I’ve joined, and I’m fucking thrilled to see what the future brings.
