					Behold Observer. Gaze upon the illusive and unbelievably dashing answer to the eternal question that is; “Who is Shogun?” I am the Shogun of Sauce, The Lord of Words, the Antithesis and so much more.
					<br><br>It goes without saying that I am unimaginably amazing and utterly baffling to try and understand. All you lore hogs out there will find not a scrape of my backstory by digging around where you think I can’t see you.
					<br><br>I bet you’re asking yourself; “Shogun, how did you possibly end up here on this page, where people who do useful stuff for the Sim end up?” Well let me tell you two things;
					<ol>
					<br><li>	I do what I want</li>
					<br><li>How dare you imply I haven’t done anything useful for this. I’ve at least had my face slapped on the homepage.</li>
					</ol>
					<br><br>You might see me coming to visit your pitiful session some day. In which case, I can offer this advice. Good luck Observer. You’ll need all that Light can give you and more.
